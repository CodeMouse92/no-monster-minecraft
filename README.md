## Purpose

My mother, Anne, enjoys playing Minecraft with me, but she's never liked dealing with hostile mobs, so we usually turn those off. The trouble is, without monsters, there are so many important items you can never get! What's more, Peaceful mode just makes things *too* easy. (We want to be able to eat.)

This data pack fixes all that!

While I was at it, I decided to fix a bunch of things that commonly drive my mother nuts about Minecraft: animals drops are more realistic, carrots and potatoes can be found elsewhere, and several "missing" recipes are implemented.

## Features

* This data pack provides alternative sources for all hostile mob drops. Some are craftable or smeltable, others come from non-hostile mob drops.

* Adjusts the loot tables for animals to be more realistic.

* Removes hostile mobs on any difficulty level. (You can control which types of hostile mobs spawn.)

I highly recommend you also install my other data pack [The Missing Recipes](https://github.com/codemouse92/the-missing-recipes), which is designed as a companion to this one. Many recipes previously included in this datapack, but not actually directly to mob drops, have been moved to there.

## Recipes

### Crafting

#### Creeper Head

4 lime dye around a skeleton skull produces a creeper head.

![Creeper Head](img/creeper_head.png)

#### Dragon Breath

Crafted from 1 blaze powder (see Blast Furnace), 1 glowstone, 1 ghast tear,
and 1 sweet berries.

![Dragon Breath](img/dragon_breath.png)

Okay, I'll admit, the only reason berries are included here is because my mother was asking if there was *anything* she could do with berries besides eat them. In any case, it adds to the initial difficulty of crafting.

#### Gunpowder

Crafted from 1 coal or charcoal, 1 bonemeal, and 1 ghast tear.

![Gunpowder](img/gunpowder.png)
![Gunpowder](img/gunpowder2.png)

In real life, gunpowder is made from charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur.
I'm substituting ghast tears for sulfur and bone meal for sulfur (although
that last one is a total scientific fabricator!)

### Music Discs

Crafted from 1 dye sandwiched between 2 phantom membrane. The type of dye
corresponds with the music disc.

![Music Disc](img/music_disc.png)

The recipe for 11 is hidden (unless you cheat and read the code!)

It is not possible to craft Pigstep: these are very rare, and can only
be found in the world.

#### Nether Star

Crafted from 8 blaze powder (see Blast Furnace) and 1 diamond.

![Nether Star](img/nether_star.png)

#### Nether Wart

Nether wart is now recoverable from nether wart blocks. One block yields nine
nether warts.

![Nether Wart](img/nether_wart.png)

#### Rotten Flesh

Pork, beef, or mutton can be fermented into rotten flesh when combined with
1 sugar and 1 brown mushroom.

![Rotten Flesh](img/rotten_flesh.png)

This recipe is based on that of a fermented spider eye.

#### Slimeball

Crafted from 1 kelp or cactus and 1 egg; yields 2 slimeballs.

![Slimeball](img/slimeball.png)
![Slimeball](img/slimeball2.png)

This recipe is inspired by real life glue made from mucilage, of which
kelp and cactus are prime sources. I replaced the water typically used with
egg, which can also be used to make adhesive in real life.

#### String

Crafted from 1 white wool (yields 14 string) or 1 white carpet (yields 9 string).

![String](img/string1.png)
![String](img/string2.png)

Of course, making yarn in real life is never this easy...

#### Totem of Undying

Made from 4 gold ingots, 2 emeralds, 1 gold nugget, and 1 nether star.

![Totem of Undying](img/totem_of_undying.png)

I like to imagine that it's the nether star which absorbs the damage for the player.

#### Trident

Made from 3 prismarine crystals (see Blast Furnace) and 4 prismarine shards.

![Trident](img/trident.png)

#### Zombie Head

8 rotten flesh around a skeleton skull produces a zombie head. Not sure why
you'd want this, but hey...here it is!

![Zombie Head](img/zombie_head.png)

#### Wither Skeleton Skull

Made from 1 skeleton skull and 1 coal or charcoal.

![Wither Skeleton Skull](img/wither_skeleton_skull.png)

#### White Carpet

Since 1 white carpet can yield 9 string (above), the inverse is true as well.

![Wool](img/white_carpet.png)

### Smelting & Blasting

To preserve some challenge of obtaining materials previously only available as hostile mob drops, I've chosen to require use of a blast furnace on most of these. Presumably, it's the high temperature that transforms the materials.

#### Blaze Powder

Blasting crimson roots yields blaze powder.

![Blaze Powder](img/blaze_powder.png)

#### Blaze Rod

Blasting weeping vines yields a blaze rod.

![Blaze Rod](img/blaze_rod.png)

#### Dragon Egg

The Dragon Egg has always been a coveted decor item, but now it has another use:
a way to gain a lot of experience very quickly!

Placing a Dragon Egg into a blast furnace yields...itself. (What can we say,
dragon eggs really like being warm!) But it also produces *400 experience* in
the process!

![Dragon Egg](img/dragon_egg.png)

You're going to need a *lot* of fuel and time for this, however.

Don't worry about the dragon egg hatching, though â€” *that* takes thousands of
years. Just keep the egg warm, and you'll reap the benefits.

#### Ender Pearl

Blasting a warped wart block yields an ender pearl.

![Ender Pearl](img/ender_pearl.png)

#### End Rod

Blasting a twisting vine yields an end rod.

![End Rod](img/end_rod.png)

This is intended as a logical complement to blasting a weeping vine into a blaze rod; an end rod is a "warping" of a blaze rod, one of its constituent ingredients.

#### Ghast Tear

Blasting warped roots yields a ghast tear.

![Ghast Tear](img/ghast_tears.png)

#### Phantom Membrane

Blasting leather yields a phantom membrane.

![Phantom Membrane](img/phantom_membrane.png)

#### Prismarine Crystal

Blasting a prismarine shard yields prismarine crystals.

![Prismarine Crystal](img/prismarine_crystal.png)

I imagine this works because it refines the impurities out of the shard.

### Stonecutter

#### Skeleton Skull

You can carve a skeleton skull with a bone block on a stonecutter. (Added for my pal Scarecrowman.)

![Skull](img/skeleton_skull.png)

## Drops

### Animal Drops

Killing most animals now always yields bones and (if appropriate) meat. There is also a rare possibility of a skull being dropped. Larger animals drop more bones.

The amounts below are only without looting.

* Chicken: 1 raw chicken, 1-2 feathers.
* Cow: 2-3 raw beef, 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Donkey: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Hoglin: 2-4 raw pork, 1-2 leather, 1-2 bones.
* Horse: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Llama: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Mooshroom: 2-3 raw beef, 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather,  1-2 red mushrooms.
* Mule: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Pig: 1-2 raw pork, 1-2 bones.
* Rabbit: 1 raw rabbit, 1 rabbit hide.
* Sheep: 1-2 raw mutton, 1-2 bones.
* Skeleton Horse: 3-6 bones.
* Trader Llama: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.

### Block Drops

Other wild plants might be hiding in the tall grass!

* Tall Grass -> Beetroot Seed
* Tall Grass -> Carrot
* Tall Grass -> Potato

In vanilla Minecraft, zombies are one of the only ways to get potatoes and carrots outside of finding them in a village. Since zombies are removed by this data pack, we needed another place to find these crops.

### Fishing

Several basic hostile mob drops have been added as junk or treasure from fishing, or else the probability of finding it has been increased.

* Bones (junk)
* Prismarine Shard (treasure)
* Rotten Flesh (junk)
* Spider Eye (junk)
* Wet Sponge (treasure)

Lilypads are now also junk from fishing in swamps, and their likelihood as treasure is more rare. Crafted junk is also rarer.

## Mob Control

The spawning of potentially hostile mobs are controlled by the datapack. Certain groups of mobs can be allowed by turning on particular gamerules. By default, none of these groups are allowed to spawn.

Most mobs are actually removed from the world altogether, instead of being
killed in place, to eliminate drops. The only exceptions to this are the ender dragon, to facilitate escape from the end, and the wither, to provide another source for nether stars.

You can enable or disable a group using the group rule. For example, to enable Illagers, use:

```
/data modify storage no-monster:rules spawnIllagers set value true
```

To disable Illagers, run:

```
/data remove storage no-monster:rules spawnIllagers
```

### Illagers

These are the evil villager types.

* Evokers
* Illusioners
* Pillagers
* Ravagers
* Vexes
* Vindicators
* Witches

Control with the group rule `spawnIllagers`.

Remember, you can also disable raids only using Minecraft's built-in `disableRaids` gamerule.

### Arthropods

These are hostile overworld arthropods.

* Cave Spiders
* Silverfish
* Spiders

Control with the group rule `spawnArthropods`.

### Creepers

Creepers are controlled separately, for those who don't like their stuff
getting blown to pieces...or perhaps do, but dislike other monsters.

* Creepers

Control with the group rule `spawnCreepers`.

### Monsters

These are monster-like overworld hostile mobs.

* Drowned
* Husks
* Phantom
* Slimes
* Skeletons
* Strays
* Zombies
* Zombie Villagers

Control with the group rule `spawnMonsters`.

### Guardians

These are controlled separately, since guardian spawning is limited to ocean
monuments, and thus may still be wanted.

* Elder Guardians
* Guardians

Control with the group rule `spawnGuardians`.

### Nether Mobs

These are non-monster nether mobs; there are safe ways of interacting with
these.

* Piglins
* Zombified Piglins

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherMobs`.

### Nether Hostiles

These are hostile nether mobs that don't quite classify as monsters.

* Hoglins

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherHostiles`.

### Nether Monsters

These are monster-like hostile mobs in the nether.

* Blaze
* Ghast
* Magma Cube
* Wither Skeleton

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherMonsters`.

### End Mobs

These are non-monster mobs in the End; these are safe ways of interacting with
these.

* Enderman

Control with the group rule `spawnEndMobs`.

### End Monsters

These are monster-like hostile mobs in the End. Shulkers themselves are *always*
allowed to spawn, but eliminating the shulker bullets removes their means
of hostility.

* Endermite
* Shulker bullets

Control with the group rule `spawnEndMonsters`.

## Bosses

Because all items necessary to spawn bosses are accessible without other
hostile mobs being enabled, these can be controlled separately as well.

* Ender Dragon
* Wither

Dragons are automatically killed upon spawning, so they still drop their
loot and produce a portal. Withers are removed so they don't spawn cheap
nether stars - use the added recipe instead.

Control with the group rule `spawnBosses`.

### Non-Controlled Mobs

One of the reasons for the datapack is the assumption that *some* challenge is desired. Just for reference, the following mobs are potentially dangerous to the player, but are not affected by this datapack:

* Bees
* Dolphins
* Iron Golems
* Llamas
* Pandas
* Polar Bears
* Pufferfish
* Shulkers
* Trader Llamas
* Wolves

All passive mobs are also unaffected.

Some recipes based on Craftman by TheDiamondPlayables

## Purpose

My mother, Anne, enjoys playing Minecraft with me, but she's never liked dealing with hostile mobs, so we usually turn those off. The trouble is, without monsters, there are so many important items you can never get! What's more, Peaceful mode just makes things *too* easy. (We want to be able to eat.)

This data pack fixes all that!

While I was at it, I decided to fix a bunch of things that commonly drive my mother nuts about Minecraft: animals drops are more realistic, carrots and potatoes can be found elsewhere, and several "missing" recipes are implemented.

## Features

* This data pack provides alternative sources for all hostile mob drops. Some are craftable or smeltable, others come from non-hostile mob drops.

* Adds the "missing recipes": saddles, bells, chain mail, elytra, and so on.

* Removes hostile mobs on any difficulty level. (You can control which types of
hostile mobs spawn.)

## Recipes

### Crafting

#### Bell

Crafted with 3 sticks, 3 gold ingots, and 1 gold nugget.

![Bell](/img/bell.png)

#### Chainmail

Crafted using standard armor shapes, but with iron nuggets instead of ingots.

![Chainmail Boots](img/chainmail_boots.png)
![Chainmail Chestplate](img/chainmail_chestplate.png)
![Chainmail Helmet](img/chainmail_helmet.png)
![Chainmail Leggings](img/chainmail_leggings.png)

#### Cobweb

Crafted from 4 string and 1 slimeball.

![Cobweb](img/cobweb.png)

#### Dragon Breath

Crafted from 1 blaze powder (see Blast Furnace), 1 glowstone, 1 ghast tear,
and 1 sweet berries.

![Dragon Breath](img/dragon_breath.png)

Okay, I'll admit, the only reason berries are included here is because my mother was asking if there was *anything* she could do with berries besides eat them. In any case, it adds to the initial difficulty of crafting.

#### Elytra

Crafted from 3 sticks, 4 phantom membrane (see Blast Furnace), and 1 iron nugget.

![Elytra](img/elytra.png)

#### Enchanted Golden Apple

Crafted from 8 gold blocks and 1 golden apple.

![Enchanted Golden Apple](img/enchanted_golden_apple.png)

#### Globe Banner Pattern

Crafted from 1 paper and 1 diamond.

#### Gunpowder

Crafted from 1 coal or charcoal, 1 bonemeal, and 1 ghast tear.

![Gunpowder](img/gunpowder.png)
![Gunpowder](img/gunpowder2.png)

In real life, gunpowder is made from charcoal, saltpeter, and sulfur.
I'm substituting ghast tears for sulfur and bone meal for sulfur (although
that last one is a total scientific fabricator!)

#### Leather

Craftable from nine bamboo. (You can still get it from the usual sources.)

![Leather](img/leather.png)

### Music Discs

Crafted from 1 dye sandwiched between 2 phantom membrane. The type of dye
corresponds with the music disc.

#### Name Tag

Crafted from 1 string and 1 paper.

![Name Tag](img/nametag.png)

#### Nether Star

Crafted from 8 blaze powder (see Blast Furnace) and 1 diamond.

![Nether Star](img/nether_star.png)

#### Nether Wart

Nether wart is now recoverable from nether wart blocks. One block yields nine
nether warts.

![Nether Wart](img/nether_wart.png)

#### Purple Dye

Craftable from 1 sweet berries.

#### Red Sand

Crafted from 8 sand and 1 red dye.

#### Saddle

Crafted from 4 leather and 2 iron ingots.

![Saddle](img/saddle.png)

#### Slimeball

Crafted from 1 kelp or cactus and 1 egg; yields 2 slimeballs.

![Slimeball](img/slimeball.png)
![Slimeball](img/slimeball2.png)

This recipe is inspired by real life glue made from mucilage, of which
kelp and cactus are prime sources. I replaced the water typically used with
egg, which can also be used to make adhesive in real life.

#### String

Crafted from 1 white wool block and 1 stick; yields 32 string.

![String](img/string.png)

Of course, making yarn in real life is never this easy...

#### Totem of Undying

Made from 4 gold ingots, 2 emeralds, 1 gold nugget, and 1 nether star.

![Totem of Undying](img/totem_of_undying.png)

I like to imagine that it's the nether star which absorbs the damage for the player.

#### Trident

Made from 3 prismarine crystals (see Blast Furnace) and 4 prismarine shards.

![Trident](img/trident.png)

#### Wither Skeleton Skull

Made from 1 skeleton skull and 1 coal or charcoal.

![Wither Skeleton Skull](img/wither_skeleton_skull.png)

### Smelting & Blasting

To preserve some challenge of obtaining materials previously only available as hostile mob drops, I've chosen to require use of a blast furnace on a few of these. Presumably, it's the high temperature that transforms the materials.

#### Blaze Powder

Smelting or blasting crimson fungi, warped fungi, nether wart, or nether sprouts yields blaze powder.

![Blaze Powder](img/blaze_powder.png)
![Blaze Powder](img/blaze_powder2.png)
![Blaze Powder](img/blaze_powder3.png)
![Blaze Powder](img/blaze_powder4.png)

#### Blaze Rod

Smelting or blasting weeping vines, crimson roots, or warped roots yields a blaze rod.

![Blaze Rod](img/blaze_rod.png)
![Blaze Rod](img/blaze_rod2.png)
![Blaze Rod](img/blaze_rod3.png)

#### Charcoal

Finally, a use for poisonous potatoes! Blasting a potato or poisonous potato in a blast furnace makes charcoal.

![Charcoal](img/charcoal.png)
![Charcoal](img/charcoal2.png)

This is based on an incident when I was 10, when I accidentally set a potato on fire in the microwave, producing charcoal (and destroying the microwave). Oops!

#### Ender Pearl

Smelting or blasting warped wart block yields an ender pearl.

![Ender Pearl](img/ender_pearl.png)

#### Ghast Tear

Smithing or blasting basalt yields a ghast tear.

![Ghast Tear](img/ghast_tears.png)

#### Phantom Membrane

Blasting leather yields a phantom membrane.

![Phantom Membrane](img/phantom_membrane.png)

#### Prismarine Crystal

Blasting a prismarine shard yields prismarine crystals.

![Prismarine Crystal](img/prismarine_crystal.png)

I imagine this works because it refines the impurities out of the shard.

## Drops

### Animal Drops

Killing most animals now always yields bones and (if appropriate) meat. There is also a rare possibility of a skull being dropped. Larger animals drop more bones.

The amounts below are only without looting.

* Chicken: 1 raw chicken, 1-2 feathers.
* Cow: 2-3 raw beef, 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Donkey: 1-2  bones, 1-2 leather.
* Horse: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Llama: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Mooshroom: 2-3 raw beef, 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather,  1-2 red mushrooms.
* Mule: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.
* Pig: 1-2 raw pork, 1-2 bones.
* Rabbit: 1 raw rabbit, 1 rabbit hide.
* Sheep: 1-2 raw mutton, 1-2 bones.
* Skeleton Horse: 3-6 bones.
* Trader Llama: 1-2 bones, 1-2 leather.

### Block Drops

Other wild plants might be hiding in the tall grass!

* Tall Grass -> Beetroot Seed
* Tall Grass -> Carrot
* Tall Grass -> Potato

In vanilla Minecraft, zombies are one of the only ways to get potatoes and carrots outside of finding them in a village. Since zombies are removed by this data pack, we needed another place to find these crops.

### Fishing

Several basic hostile mob drops have been added as junk or treasure from fishing, or else the probability of finding it has been increased.

* Bones (junk)
* Prismarine Shard (treasure)
* Rotten Flesh (junk)
* Spider Eye (junk)
* Wet Sponge (treasure)

Lilypads are now also junk from fishing in swamps, and their likelihood as treasure is more rare. Crafted junk is also rarer.

## Mob Control

The spawning of potentially hostile mobs are controlled by the datapack. Certain groups of mobs can be allowed by turning on particular gamerules. By default, none of these groups are allowed to spawn.

Most mobs are actually removed from the world altogether, instead of being
killed in place, to eliminate drops. The only exceptions to this are the ender dragon, to facilitate escape from the end, and the wither, to provide another source for nether stars.

You can enable or disable a group using the group rule. For example, to enable Illagers, use:

```
/data modify storage no-monster:rules spawnIllagers set value true
```

To disable Illagers, run:

```
/data modify remove no-monster:rules spawnIllagers
```

### Illagers

These are the evil villager types.

* Evokers
* Illusioners
* Pillagers
* Ravagers
* Vexes
* Vindicators
* Witches

Control with the group rule `spawnIllagers`.

Remember, you can also disable raids only using Minecraft's built-in `disableRaids` gamerule.

### Arthropods

These are hostile overworld arthropods.

* Cave Spiders
* Silverfish
* Spiders

Control with the group rule `spawnArthropods`.

### Monsters

These are monster-like overworld hostile mobs.

* Creepers
* Drowned
* Husks
* Phantom
* Slimes
* Skeletons
* Strays
* Zombies
* Zombie Villagers

Control with the group rule `spawnMonsters`.

### Guardians

These are controlled separately, since guardian spawning is limited to ocean
monuments, and thus may still be wanted.

* Elder Guardians
* Guardians

Control with the group rule `spawnGuardians`.

### Nether Mobs

These are non-monster nether mobs; there are safe ways of interacting with
these.

* Piglins
* Zombie Pigmen/Zombified Piglins

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherMobs`.

### Nether Hostiles

These are hostile nether mobs that don't quite classify as monsters.

* Hoglins

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherHostiles`.

### Nether Monsters

These are monster-like hostile mobs in the nether.

* Blaze
* Ghast
* Magma Cube
* Wither Skeleton

Control with the group rule `spawnNetherMonsters`.

### End Mobs

These are non-monster mobs in the End; these are safe ways of interacting with
these.

* Enderman

Control with the group rule `spawnEndMobs`.

### End Monsters

These are monster-like hostile mobs in the End. Shulkers themselves are *always*
allowed to spawn, but eliminating the shulker bullets removes their means
of hostility.

* Endermite
* Shulker bullets

Control with the group rule `spawnEndMonsters`.

## Bosses

Because all items necessary to spawn bosses are accessible without other
hostile mobs being enabled, these can be controlled separately as well.
By default, bosses are automatically killed upon spawning.

* Ender Dragon
* Wither

Control with the group rule `spawnBosses`.

### Non-Controlled Mobs

One of the reasons for the datapack is the assumption that *some* challenge is
desired. Just for reference, the following mobs are potentially dangerous to
the player, but are not affected by this datapack:

* Bees
* Dolphins
* Iron Golems
* Llamas
* Pandas
* Polar Bears
* Pufferfish
* Shulkers
* Trader Llamas
* Wolves

All passive mobs are also unaffected.

## Junk Traders

NOTE: Not yet implemented. Coming soon!

Any old iron! Any old iron! Instead of being completely useless, Nitwits are now Junk Traders. They'll happily buy and sell junk none of the other villagers want.

* Bones
* Sticks
* Iron Nuggets
